🔷 Recently I've explored a modern e-commerce service "CDEK.Shopping" which is a part of CDEK, the large international logistics company providing delivery in 25 countries. I tested the website and the app and created the bug report with some issues that appeared frequently

 📌 Trying to improve my QA skills with different assignments: https://github.com/EvgeniaAn/portfolio

  ☑️ The project of mobile game "[My Little Universe](https://github.com/EvgeniaAn/portfolio/blob/main/Project%20for%20App%20-%20My%20Little%20Universe.pdf)". I did analysis of bugs and issues that appeared during the game. Also I tried to understand the core mechanics and analyze what users like and dislike.

  ☑️ [Testing the Elevator](https://github.com/EvgeniaAn/portfolio/blob/main/Testing%20of%20Elevator%20-%20Check%20list.pdf) and writing the check list to it, I tried to point out all types of functional and unfunctional testing + use some test design techniques that can be helpful for creating test cases.  

 ✅ Previously worked on Volunteer project: https://trello.com/b/6JvrNtZT/bug-tracker 
<br />
    The task was to find all bugs in customer's project according to the tech task and create trello desk as my vision of bugfixing process in different companies.
